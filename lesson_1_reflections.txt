How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
The diff shows the differences so you only have to look to an small number of lines the find the error

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Because you could understand what has changed and produced the differences in the results

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
The pros are more control and the cons are that you can forget to do the commit when it is time

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because its a programming characteristic to have a group of files that need to be coordinated in order to produce an ouput

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can test whatever you want knowing that your are safe to go backwards without problem
